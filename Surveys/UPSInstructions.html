			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p class="p1">The purpose of this study is to understand why social network users decide not to share certain content with their "friends."</p>
            <div id="yourtask">
			<h3>Your Task</h3>
			<p class="p1">We want you to send us everything you would like to post on Facebook but do not post.  That is, send us your ideas for posts or pictures.  We are interested in the ideas that do not get posted.</p>  

<p>Over the next week, whenever you encounter a situation or a thought that you would like to share with some of your friends on Facebook, but decide not to share, <span class="bold"><ul><li>send a text message to (xxx) xxx-xxxx with a short description of that content</li></ul></span>.  This text message should contain: <ul><li>type of content (e.g. direct message, wall post, picture, etc)</li><li>what the content would contain</li></ul>  </p>

<p>At the end of each day, we will send you an e-mail with a link to a webpage.  You will be asked to fill out a brief survey based on the content you send us.  Once you finish the survey, simply hit <span class="italic">Submit</span>.  You may continue sending us text messages about any content you decide not to post. </p>

<p>In total, the study will run for 7 days. If you fill out at least 4 of the nightly surveys, at the end of this time period we will contact you to schedule a time come in to our lab on the Carnegie Mellon campus for an one-hour long interview.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Please remember</span>, during this survey you may provide information that may relate to other people. When answering these questions, please only identify other people by first name or nickname. Please do not include other people's full names, Facebook identifiers, email addresses, phone numbers, or addresses
